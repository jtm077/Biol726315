Today, we initiated mamba and activated the class environment created by Dr.Toomey :) (Thank you Dr.Toomey!)


After logging out and back into OSCER, we activated the environment and downloaded sequence data, reference data, and databases.

Instructions to do this are here :)

We worked with the bacterial species Escherichia coli.

I ran the 'fastqc' program to examine the quality of the two raw read sequence data we retrieved using these files:
* [ecoli_fastqc.sbatch]
* [ecoli_fastqc.sh]

These files were outputted from this job:
* [read_1_fastqc]
* [read_2_fastqc]

Then I made this markdown document (insert sunglasses).
